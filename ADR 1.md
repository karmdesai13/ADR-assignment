# ADR1: Choice of App Development Approach

## Title: Native vs Web vs Hybrid App Development

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**
The development team faces a decision regarding the choice of app type  native, hybrid, or web  for the retail company's mobile app. The retail company's requirements include enabling customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, track deliveries, and access the app offline. The team must consider these requirements and weigh the pros and cons of each app type.

**Decision: Native App Development**

After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each app type and considering the app's specific requirements, the team has decided to proceed with Native App Development. The reasons for choosing Native App Development are as follows:

**Performance:** Native App Development offers superior performance across platforms. Native apps can be built individually for Android and iOS platforms, fully utilizing the capabilities of device hardware and software. This results in a smooth user experience with animations and reduced loading times between screens.

**Offline Browsing:** The company's requirement for offline access is a crucial factor behind choosing Native App Development. Native apps can store data locally, resulting in faster data loading when an internet connection is established. This also enhances data security as data can be encrypted locally on the device.

**Device-Specific Features:** The company also desires features like push notifications and order tracking. Native apps make implementing these features easier as they can utilize the device's push notification system for updates on new deals and order tracking.

**Consequences**

**Positive Consequences:**

1. **High Performance:** Native apps will deliver the best performance to customers, with minimal loading times between screens and when loading and displaying data.

2. **Security:** Native apps will ensure data security as data can be stored locally on the device, utilizing both device security features and app encryption and security protocols to keep data safe.

**Negative Consequences:**

1. **High Expenditure:** Native App Development involves higher expenses due to separate development for Android and iOS platforms. It also requires maintenance across both platforms.

2. **Development Complexity:** Building for both platforms with their own databases results in coding two different databases and a more time-consuming process.
