# ADR 2: UI Framework

## Title: UI Framework Selection for Native Mobile App

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**
The user interface is crucial for the success of our native shopping app, which aims to cater to an international audience with diverse language and cultural requirements. The app's design needs to be versatile and attractive on both Android and iOS platforms. We must select a UI framework that balances performance, development speed, and adaptability.

**Decision: React Native**

We have decided to use React Native as the primary UI framework for our mobile app. React Native is a mature framework that allows us to build applications for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. It offers a balance between performance, development speed, and adaptability. This decision is based on the following reasons:

**User-Friendly Design:** React Native enables a user-friendly design that appeals to a global audience. The app's navigation and layout will be easy to understand, regardless of the user's location. Users can easily browse products, view orders, and use the loyalty program, resulting in a more enjoyable shopping experience.

**Flexibility:** React Native is designed to be flexible. It allows for easy adjustments and updates as new features or changes are introduced. This flexibility ensures that the app can adapt to the retail company's evolving services without requiring a complete rebuild, saving time and resources.

**Language Support:** To support international users, we will use Apple's language support tools for iPhones and Google's tools for Android phones. We will keep all translations in one place to facilitate updates as we add more languages and accommodate diverse cultures.

**Consequences:**

**Positive Consequences:**

1. **User-Friendly Design:** The app's design will attract a global audience, ensuring that users from different locations find the navigation easy to understand and the layout appealing.

2. **Flexibility:** React Native's flexibility allows for easy adaptation to new features and changes, saving time and resources.

**Negative Consequences:**

1. **Updates and Quality:** Regular app updates are necessary, especially when adding new features. Communicating updates to users and ensuring smooth updates that don't disrupt user data or settings is essential for the best user experience.

2. **Cultural Adjustments:** Maintaining uniform quality across diverse devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, and OS versions requires rigorous testing to ensure a consistent user experience. Additionally, global expansion necessitates recognizing and including local differences in design and functionality.
