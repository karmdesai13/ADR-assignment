# ADR 6: Any Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks

## Title: Decisions on Including Additional Frameworks or Technology

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**
The development team is exploring new technologies and frameworks to enhance the mobile app. The retail company desires features such as product browsing, push notifications, and order tracking for their customers. The team is also considering the pros and cons of new technologies.

**Decision: Ant Design and Google Analytics**

After evaluating the app's requirements, the team has decided to incorporate Ant Design and Google Analytics into the app development. The reasons for choosing these additions are as follows:

**Ant Design:**
Ant Design will be used to visually enhance the app interface and create a user-friendly design. Ant Design seamlessly integrates with native React and Node.js, which are core technologies used in the app. It allows for efficient editing of mobile interfaces and offers robust compatibility with the chosen tech stack.

**Google Analytics:**
Google Analytics will be used for tracking user interactivity and generating insights into app usage. These insights can be leveraged to enhance the app's performance and user experience. Additionally, Google Analytics can provide valuable data to improve the recommendation algorithm for customers.

**Consequences:**

**Positive Consequences:**

1. **App Usage Patterns:** By incorporating Google Analytics, the development team can gain valuable insights into app usage and user interactions. This data can inform decisions to optimize the app's features and functionality.

2. **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Ant Design facilitates efficient management of both the mobile and web versions of the app. This consistency in design and user experience across platforms can improve the app's accessibility and user satisfaction.

**Negative Consequences:**

1. **Data Security:** While using Google Analytics, data security is of paramount importance. Google Analytics may have access to personal information, potentially raising privacy concerns. The development team must implement measures to ensure data security and compliance with privacy policies.

2. **Workload:** The inclusion of both Ant Design and Google Analytics will increase the workload of the development team. Managing these tools, handling new package releases, and staying updated with their respective technologies may lead to increased financial expenditure and require additional resources.
